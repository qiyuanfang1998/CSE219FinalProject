# CSE219FinalProject
Final Project for my JAVAFX Software Design class at Stony Brook University

# Description
MetroMapMaker is a full fledged JAVAFX Application that allows users to create custom metro system maps with lines, stations, images, and backgrounds, as well as text labels. It utilizes several frameworks provided by Stony Brook University in order to facilitate development.

The metro maps created by MetroMapMaker are capable of being saved, and are done so in a web friendly JSON format, allowing for display on websites dedicated to this purpose.

# Purpose
To demonstrate a proficency in JavaFX and technologies such as XML and JSON as well as git and large project management.
